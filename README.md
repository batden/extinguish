# extinguish

Use this script to uninstall Enlightenment and related applications.

## Get started

First, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/batden/extinguish.git .extinguish
```

This creates a new hidden folder named .extinguish in your home directory.

Copy the extinguish.sh file from the new .extinguish folder to somewhere else and make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x extinguish.sh
```

Then execute the script with:

```bash
./extinguish.sh
```

That's it.
