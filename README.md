# extinguish (WIP)

**Use this script to uninstall Enlightenment and related applications.**

Please take a look at the comments in the script (lines beginning with '#') before running it.

*See also [elluminate.sh](https://github.com/batden/elluminate)*

## Get started

First, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/batden/extinguish.git .extinguish
```

This creates a new hidden folder named **.extinguish** in your home directory.

Copy the file extinguish.sh from this new folder to the download folder.

Now change to the download folder and make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x extinguish.sh
```

Then issue the following command:

```bash
./extinguish.sh
```

### Update local repository

Change to ~/.extinguish/ and run:

```bash
git pull
```

That's it.
