# extinguish

Use this script to uninstall Enlightenment and related applications.

## Get started

First, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/batden/extinguish.git .extinguish
```

This creates a new hidden folder named .extinguish in your home directory.

Copy the extinguish.sh file from the new .extinguish folder to your download folder.

Navigate to the download folder and make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x extinguish.sh
```

Then execute the script with:

```bash
./extinguish.sh
```

## Update local repo

Change to ~/.extinguish/ and run:

```bash
git pull
```
